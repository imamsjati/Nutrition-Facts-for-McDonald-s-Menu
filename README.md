Introduction

Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of cosistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald's but for themselves, together with McDonald's. Many of McDonald's most famous menu item's - Like Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin were created by franchisees
